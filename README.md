# myMakeChange

## Summary
 MakeChange is a java application created with eclipse that displays the change returned to a user based on the amount tendered. This is a week one homework assignment.
## Stories
User Story #1

The user is prompted asking for the price of the item.

User Story #2

The user is then prompted asking how much money was tendered by the customer.

User Story #3

Display an appropriate message if the customer provided too little money or the exact amount.

User Story #4

If the amount tendered is more than the cost of the item, display the number of bills and coins that should be given to the customer.
## Reflection 
The week one project tested my understanding of basic arithmatic and moodular expressions while being able to use provide change in cases releveant to the user story.
